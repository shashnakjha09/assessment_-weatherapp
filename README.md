# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

NOTE : due to some technical issue with API  the MAx and Min Temp is same because of that the Chart is not sowing the Max Temp reading properly,
if you want to see the both reading you can click on blue line in the chart and over on the break points.
## project is based on Hooks and statemanagement.
